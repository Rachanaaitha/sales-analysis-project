EDA and Sales Prediction using Linear Regression
# Task 2 â€“ Sales Performance Analysis

This project is part of the **Main Flow Data Analysis and Data Science with Python** series.

##  Project Overview

The objective of this task is to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and build a **predictive model** using linear regression to understand the factors influencing sales performance.

##  Key Steps

1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Removed duplicates and handled missing values
   - Converted date columns to datetime format

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Visualized sales trends over time
   - Analyzed relationships between profit and discount
   - Compared sales performance by region and category

3. **Predictive Modeling**
   - Built a Linear Regression model
   - Features used: Profit, Discount, Quantity, Shipping Cost
   - Achieved **RÂ² score: 0.68** and **MSE: 71,376**
